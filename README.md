# Hello-World

Hi, I'm Shengyun Zheng, a student at Thomas A. Edison High School.
I'm interested in software developer / computer programming. 
I'm currently learning the basics of coding using javascripts, with the help of github and popcode.
I'm looking to collaborate on projects on websites and apps.
I can be reached at my email shengyunzheng2004@gmail.com.
